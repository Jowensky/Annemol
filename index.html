            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
                The Japanese Macaque is found in four separate regions in Japan throughout a variety
                of habitats from subtropical jungles to hot mountain springs, in forested hills, across
                highlands and high up in the mountains.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior & Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>
                Japanese Macaques live together in troops that are led by the alpha male and usually
                consist of between 20 and 30 individuals. The alpha male not only helps to sire young,
                but also decides where the troop should go, and protects it from both predators and other
                Japanese Macaque troops. Social rank is very important in Japanese Macaque society, and
                consist of both males and females, with the male's rank often determined by his age.
            </p>
            <h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
            <p>
                The females are actually very picky when choosing a mate, as they will not mate with a male
                Japanese Macaque that they have mated with in the past few years, to prevent interbreeding
                within the troop.
