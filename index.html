                The fur of the Japanese macaque can vary among shades of brown from grey or yellow brown
                to exclusively brown. Japanese macaques have a pinkish face and posterior with a short stump of a tail.
                There is a degree of sexual dimorphism between male and female Japanese macaques with the males
                weighing somewhat more than the females and on average having a longer body length than the females.
                there appears to be a correlation between climate and body weight, as Japanese monkeys
                from northern colder areas weigh more than those from warmer areas of Japan. Longevity for males
                has been confirmed as long as 28 years and into the 32nd year of life for females.
